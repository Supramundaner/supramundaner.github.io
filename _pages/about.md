I am a third-year BSc student in [Data Science and Technology +AI](https://dsct.hkust.edu.hk/) at [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)](https://hkust.edu.hk/). My research interests are centered on machine learning and computer vision, with a particular focus on creating unified models for 2D and 3D data to enable a human-like understanding of the real world. My most recent work has been concentrated on 3D vision. I have been fortunate to work with [Prof. Chi-Keung Tang](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/~cktang/bio.html) and [Prof. Yu-Wing Tai ](https://yuwingtai.github.io/)on computer vision.
