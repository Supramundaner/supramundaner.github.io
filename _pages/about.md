I am Ao Yuzhuo, an undergraduate student at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), where I am pursuing a BSc in Data Science and Technology with an Extended Major in AI.

My research interests primarily focus on machine learning and computer vision. I am particularly interested in the unified modeling of 2D and 3D data to achieve a human-like understanding of the real world. My recent focus has been centered on 3D vision.

This past summer, I attended a summer exchange program at Nanyang Technological University. I am now looking forward to exchanging to EPFL for the spring semester in 2026.```
